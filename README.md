# AlgorithmicFreeSound

A FreeSound API client that has been streamlined for making algorithmic/generative music.

This is a greatly simplified client for the FreeSound API. It only supports those operations that enable creation of generative music. If you are looking for a full featured API client that enables uploading files, adding comments, and more, then check out FreeSound-Java at https://github.com/Sonoport/freesound-java.
